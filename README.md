# RelativeRank

The point of this project is to solve the issue of people having different numerical systems
for how they rank shows. One persons 7 could be another persons 6 for example.

What this system does is force people to maintain a sequential of shows ranked strictly from
most liked to least liked, and then maps a score in between 0 and 1 to each show based on its
position in that list. Those scores calculated from this sequencial ranking are then averaged
to get an overall ranking for a show.

I'm using anime because I like anime, but this system could be aplied to ranking anything that can be ranked ordinally.
